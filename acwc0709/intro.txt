## AC World Cup - ACWC ##


# So, what's happening? #

The cup was originally meant to start on 19th June but was delayed to
19th July because the organiser (Nighthawk) simply has not enough time
for it. Since he's not responding to my e-mails, I decided that it'd be
better to get a vote from people for me to take care of the ACWC perhaps
along with a few others that I may select.

# How the teams are selected #

Find yourself a team of 4 players who are currently living in the same country
or have the same nationality, one being a substitute and the other three being
the main players. A country is allowed more than one team. I decided this
because there may be disputes between who is actually going to represent
their country. The first 8 countries to sign up will be on the list. Only one
actual team of a country will compete in the cup. Before that, for example,
if a Brazilian team signs up 5th, and then another Brazilian team signs up 9th,
we will have a face-off between the two teams to find out which is the better
one to represent their team. We will do these games on 18th July.


# How to enter your team #

E-mail to: 	comp -at- woop -period- us    (period = .) 
I'll need: Country name, list of players, their contacts (at least 2),
any IRC channels and timezone information (which UTC timezone each person is
located in). 


# How it will be organised #

Still depends on how many teams join in. Currently we take it to be 8 countries.
We hope that you are prepared on the 18th throughout the whole day (it's a Saturday)
and 19th (Sunday) for the whole day too, to play any games.
Don't sign up if it's not possible.

Random assignments will be made for the first matches and times will be chosen the
day before, so please check the website. 

On the day of the games, you will already know the times for which you have to turn
up to the servers and which team you will be playing against. Anybody not turning up
will forfeit by default. Missing players can be filled in only if they are from the
same country. Substitutes will be called in as soon as they are required and games
must pause whenever someone quits by software or hardware error.

In total, each face-off between two teams will be based on a best-of-three outcome.
If there is a tie at the end of a match, it is counted as +0 to both teams, and if 
not, the winning team gets +1 and the losing team gets +0. First two games must be
played, and if the teams have the same score, games are continued for as long as
necessary to give a differentiating score. The team with more points wins.

After the first day is complete, we'll get onto the 19th July, and complete the second
round. After that, we'll have two teams left, which will fight in a final the week
after with special arrangements.
