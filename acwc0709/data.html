<p>Round 1: Two very good teams against each other forsees a nice match.
Both teams chose to try each other out in the beginning.
The Finnish decided to use an offensive orientated strategy
while the Germans clearly use a defensive approach. With the end
of the first half coming closer, Germany become more offensive together
with nice defensive rotations which give them a 2 flags lead.</p>
<p>Round 2: Germany had some troubles in the start with the Finnish
offense but they could quickly switch back to their playstyle of the first round.
The_Rock and tenshi became more offensive giving Smack some support on the attacking side.
A lot of hot action in both bases, sweet flag returns and caps in this second half.</p>
<p>Finland did everything they could but in the end Germany gets back in their
defensive style to succesfully protect their lead.</p>

<p>Round 1: Early in the game it was obvious that it was going to be a close match.
Latinos are playing in South American style: lots of 'nades and hot SMG action.
USA has troubles to find answers but then Zenith and Impakt'd find leaks in the defense of the Latinos,
which leads to a 5 flag diffence moving into the second round.</p>
<p>Round 2: Latinos are now on the RVSF side. We have already seen in previous games that
everything can happen when you play on this easier side. Latinos are really
pushing USA around, who can't find a answer to their offensive rushes.
The Latinos team even takes virtually the overall victory but then USA changed their
strategy. It pays off, they can score some important flags going into the
last 2 minutes. Latinos take more risks and so it's easy for USA to protect their lead.
</p>
<p>At the end there were some heavy protests from the Latinos team,
claiming that Zenith did not have the right to play and they demand a rematch.
The referees investigated this matter and in the end they decided USA
wins this emotionaly exciting game.</p>

<dd>
<p>Round 1: Benelux shows up with a player who is not on their list as Seagal did not show up.
The match begins equally, and neither team dominates. Soon enough the Germans take their game to another level.
It goes too fast for Benelux and their teamplay is lost. Medusa makes some nice flag-runs, trying to control the damage.</p>
<p>Round 2: Davitomon tries to motivate his team and wants to use a different strategy.
This fails miserable and the Germans picks up their game from previous round,
giving Benelux no chance.</p>

<dd><p>Mode: CTF, Map: ac_shine</p></dd>
<dd><p>Round 1: The match starts very equally. Neither team really dominates untill a score streak from Finland begins.
Brazil was 2 flags behind and began attacking too recklessly which gave Finland an edge to defend their lead.</p>
<p>Round 2: Brazil change their tactic. D0m1n4t0r stays in and around the home base for almost the whole second half while
his teammates attack the Finnish RVSF base. However, Finland was dominated by the Brazilians this second half. It's 6-1 for Brazil
with 1 minute to go (11-10 to Brazil). Finland is seconds away from losing the fight, and they are attacking with their fullest
to get the Brazilian flag. Brazilians instead defend with all they can but after unsuccessfully stealing the Brazilian flag, 
the Finland team is close to losing, until Jay-EM takes the flag, runs back, drops flag after getting killed right next to the base, and teppo takes it with 4hp to make a score. The game ends immediately. 
After calculating the flags and then the frags, the Brazilian team protest against the rules
since the Finnish team won against them by only 18 frags.</p>

<p>Round 2: BrB is a bit more desperate this time. The teamplay breaks down and CoxA is left on his own to get the flags and and protect himself.  BrA 3 - 1 BrB.</p></dd>
