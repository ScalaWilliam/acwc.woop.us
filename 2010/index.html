<p>So, Round 2 is over. The teams that went through are: Australia A, Brazil A, Slovakia and Germany.</p>
<p>Because of the bad timings, Round 3 will happen next week[end], and we're hoping to see Australia A fighting Brazil A on Friday evening and Slovakia fighting Germany in the same evening possibly. If times permit, the last matches will be played during the weekend, and if not, they will happen during the week after that. We'll see.</p>
<p>Thanks to all the teams that played with so much effort. The only fight where we saw HTF being played was in Australia A vs Portugal, which gave a big lead to the Australian team in the second game of the map.</p>
<p>12 matches in round 1/pre-elim, 4 matches in round 2. 42 games so far, 10 and a half hours of intense 3vs3 gameplay.</p>
<p>My apologies to the Brazilians and Latinos for being late to the match. I slept only 4 hours for that :P.</p>
<p>Maps for Round 3 will be announced when the time is right.</p>

<p>Now we go into Round 2, where we will see much more of much more difficult action. This time, teams will be given enough time to prepare for playing the maps, which will be:</p>
<pre>
tdm @ ac_complex
tdm @ ac_complex, swapped sides
ctf @ ac_shine
ctf @ ac_shine, swapped sides

The winner of each map gets a point.
If it's 1-1 after four games, then the
following two games have to be played:
htf @ ac_desert2
htf @ ac_desert2, swapped sides</pre>
<p>You will have a 5 minute break after each game and you will be allowed to change players during that time.
Extra break time is given only if the captains of both teams and the referee agree.</p>

<li id="r2g"><span class="says"><span class="name">Drakas</span> says: <span class="title"><a href="#r2g" class="subber">#</a> Round 2 matches</span></span><div class="content">
<p>Hi all, now I'll let you into more information on Round 2 matches.</p>
<p>These matches are one step up from the initial Pre-elimination and Round 1. Each match will consist of up to three different mode/maps. This means that the second game will be the same as the first game but different sides and that the fourth game will be the same as the third game but different sides, and winning each map will give you 1 point. If it is 1-1 after four games, then two more games will be played on a different map, with sides being swapped. The winner of that game will then win the match.</p>
<p>Example: A vs. B:</p>
<pre>
map     X @ ac_X  X @ ac_X  Winner:
Team A  <span style="color:blue">RVSF</span>      <span style="color:red ">CLA</span>       <span style="color:lime">Yes</span>
Team B  <span style="color:red ">CLA</span>       <span style="color:blue">RVSF</span>      No

map     Y @ ac_Y  Y @ ac_Y  Winner:
Team A  <span style="color:blue">RVSF</span>      <span style="color:red ">CLA</span>       No
Team B  <span style="color:red ">CLA</span>       <span style="color:blue">RVSF</span>      <span style="color:lime">Yes</span>
</pre>
<p>This ends up 1-1, so another one will have to be played:</p>
<pre>
map     Z @ ac_Z  Z @ ac_Z  Winner:
Team A  <span style="color:blue">RVSF</span>      <span style="color:red ">CLA</span>       No
Team B  <span style="color:red ">CLA</span>       <span style="color:blue">RVSF</span>      <span style="color:lime">Yes</span>
</pre>
<p>... and so Team B wins.</p>
<p>Since each game takes 15 minutes, and we have 5-minute breaks in-between,
that means that if a team wins after four games, it'll take 1 hour with 15 minutes of breaks,
and if a team wins after six games, it'll take 1 hour 30 minutes with 25 minutes of breaks,
which exactly fits all the given time availability slots. Breaks can be extended if agreed by
the captains of each team.
</p>
<p>Map names and modes are not yet announced.
These games will be played throughout Friday morning until Saturday afternoon,
so be very prepared to play then under relatively short notice.</p>

<p>Hi all, so far a lot of games have gone by but not everything is that finalised. I am opening some positions for people willing to watch the demos and write up commentaries like what was done for the first two games of this cup.</p>
<p>Come to IRC, write something up and send it in. You can either do it as a one-off thing or take up a position in doing it.</p>
<p>There are quite a few games to go over, and use the second game's commentary as an example. Also check out the commentary from the <a href="http://acwc.woop.us/acwc0709/data.html">2009 ACWC</a> as an example.</p>
<p>Also, if you find any specific highlights (awesome shooting), then also add in the position of time / who did it (so we can look back on these later, not through commentary).</p>

<p>Hi all, I want to clear one thing up: unless you've been e-mailed the match dates/times, the 'Match data' is only a <strong>rough guide to the potential date/time, but not necessarily confirmed</strong>.</p>
<p>Yesterday I had to re-arrange some of the fights because there was a mistake in one of my entries. Today, I had to change the USA vs. SK game because I didn't want to risk not having given enough notice.</p>
<p>I also found out that one of the teams signed up with completely availability times which they didn't try to change to make correct before registrations closed.</p>
<p>Some matches don't yet have dates attached to them because they're still unclear. As soon as dates and times are agreed to, all the teams will be e-mailed the information and this information will also be available on the site.</p>
<p>Remember that by the rules, teams cannot add or replace players.</p>
<p>Edit: where I said &quot;everyone needs to connect&quot;, I actually mean those who are playing and any substitutes that are present.</p>

<p>The current tournament tree is finally up, along with match data!</p>
<p>I spent quite a bit of time trying to find the best timings and teaming-ups, so there were a few changes from what I temporarily had up yesterday.</p>
<p>A few teams were requested to make themselves available at certain times. You were all informed individually and I ask you to make sure to reply to my requests as soon as possible!</p>
<p>For match information, I'll quote the following information I sent to one of the matching teams:</p>
<blockquote><pre>
I require at least the captains of the teams to join IRC.
There, you will be told to which server all of your team-
mates (/<i>including the substitutes</i>/) will have to
connect. I've implemented a hot-swap system which will
allow substitute players to join in as soon as any player
loses their connection. This means that if somebody
disconnects, I will put in a substitute straight away
and the game must not stop. The server will not be opened
until the game is over unless there are no other substitutes.

You will have to use AssaultCube 1.0.4 or you /<i>will</i>/
be removed from the game. Make sure you install
everything *<strong>before</strong>* the game. Remember that if three
players representing your team do not turn up, the team
will be automatically disqualified. You must connect to
the server at the given time. After 5 minutes, the
server will be privated. The game will begin 5 minutes
later. After the first game finishes, teams will be
swapped, a 5 minute break will be given and then it will
start again. The overall winner of that match proceeds to
the next round.

The match details (mode/map) you'll be playing will
be announced a little later on that same page.

This is the very first match of the cup and I hope it
goes well for all of us. Also, make sure to read the
rules in detail, *<strong>especially</strong>* regarding what is
allowed and what is not.

If you have any questions, ask in #acwc (not in private).
The captains are the main communication points before
going to me. I'm not sure if I've given all the necessary
information but I hope this is enough. 
</pre></blockquote>
<p>The breaks and the like will change later after these rounds.</p>

<dd><p>I'll try to get most of the games done this weekend, so please make sure to make yourselves more available then. If you cannot make it, it is all right as long as you can make up for it later. Teams which aren't available this weekend will be put together to play next week.</p>
<p>I <strong>will</strong> set a deadline for any teams unable to play this weekend.</p></dd>
<dt>Match dates</dt>
<dd><p>Match dates will be e-mailed out and also put on the &quot;Match data&quot; page.</p></dd>
<dt>Verification</dt>
<dd><p>Some teams whose members I don't know or haven't been unable to verify, or lack enough availability (I'd prefer to see 5+ hours per day, but 3h/day or less is not acceptable; there were teams trying to get through with 2 hours, even).</p>
<p>I have e-mailed them but there have been no sufficient responses. If I don't know you, and haven't seen you, you should at least some older demos of you playing, along with some screenshots.</p></dd>
<dt>E-mails</dt>
<dd><p></p>Please make sure to send e-mails of all your teammates. It's best if all of your teammates receive important notifications directly instead of replying on the captain to pass the message on.</p>
<p>Also, please make sure that e-mails from @woop.us are not blocked by your e-mail account.</p>

<p>Thinking about mixed teams, I noticed people try and come up with teams based on some silly ideas.</p>
<p>Therefore, I'm adding some changes. Mixed team sign-ups will only be added-on on Friday, 16th July. This means that country-based teams get priority first. Any second team for a country may in fact have to compete in a pre-tournament knock-out round if there are more than 16 country-sign-ups. There may be further changes like this but if there are 16 country-only teams signing up then mixed-teams <s>might not</s> will be able to participate (<s>I don't discourage trying for registration, though... </s>this is what determines how the cup will proceed; but first give some good effort to form a team inside a country).</p>
<p>Edit: Latino team will be allowed to compete like a country due to good reliability from the previous cup.</p>
